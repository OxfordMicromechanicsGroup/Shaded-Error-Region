# Shaded-Error-Region
The purpose of these set of codes is to make it quick and easy for one to shade in uncertainty (aka error) regions in MATLAB, which is a nicer way to show uncertainty than error bars. Prediction intervals are a great way to show the confidence of the fit to the data, and so this variant of shaded region has been utilised as a function.
